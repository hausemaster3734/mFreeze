# General
mFreeze is a plugin that simplifies administration's life by adding a new command to check for cheats.
# Command & Permission
To freeze a player, use the (/mfreeze <`player`> <`message`>) command.
Note that the administrator who is running this command must have the `mfreeze.command.use` permission.
To unfreeze a player, simply enter this command again. It works like a switch.
